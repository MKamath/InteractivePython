# Title:- Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

# Description :- 
# Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game that is played by two people. The players count to three
# in unison and simultaneously "throw” one of three hand signals that correspond to rock, paper
# or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:
# 
# 1. Rock smashes scissors
# 2. Scissors cuts paper
# 3. Paper covers rock
#
# Rock-paper-scissors is a surprisingly popular game that many people play seriously. Due to
# the fact that a tie happens around 1/3 of the time, several variants of Rock-Paper-Scissors
# exist that include more choices to make ties less likely.
# 
# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five
# choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties
# against itself. Much of RPSLS's popularity is that it has been featured in 3 episodes of the 
# TV series "The Big Bang Theory". 
# 
# In our first mini-project, we will build a Python function rpsls(name) that takes as input
# the string name, which is one of "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", or "Spock". 
# The function then simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating
# its own random choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner using a
# simple rule that we will next describe.
# 
# While Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-Spock has a set of ten rules that logically determine who wins
# a round of RPSLS, coding up these rules would require a large number (5x5=25) of if/elif/else
# clauses in your mini-project code. A simpler method for determining the winner is to assign
# each of the five choices a number:
# 
# 0 — rock
# 1 — Spock
# 2 — paper
# 3 — lizard
# 4 — scissors
#
# In this expanded list, each choice wins against the preceding two choices and loses against 
# the following two choices (if rock and scissors are thought of as being adjacent using modular
# arithmetic).
